# Symplecticity
A simple study of symplectic integrators.

The first-order symplectic Euler methods (Euler-A and Euler-B) and the second-order Störmer-Verlet are compared against a non-symplectic simple-Euler method for a single oscillator. The Störmer-Verlet method is then used to simulation a system of 128-coupled oscillators.

This was completed as a side project during my *numerische Mathematik* seminar at the Technische Universität Berlin.
